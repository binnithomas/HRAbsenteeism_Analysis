# HR Absenteeism Analysis
The Analysis mainly highlights the range of ‘absence’ being observed amongst 8336 employees from various departments, considering the important metrics and perspectives. 
## Assumptions:
1. Various aspects being depicted within the dataset relates to the ‘Current time period’.
2. The employees being considered within the dataset may or may not be subject to ‘attrition’ or ‘retirement’.  
3. The reason for ‘absence’ is not a considerable factor in this aspect. 
## Metrics:
1. Count of Employee Number : The no. of employees being considered
2. Age : The age of a specific employee
3. Length Service : Total no. of years served by a specific employee
4. Active Hour : No. of active hours observed for a specific employee at the course of worktime
5. Absent Hour : No. of absent hours observed for a specific employee at the course of worktime

## Insights:
The analysis which pertains to the range of ‘absence’ based on 8336 employees is being conducted based on the major ‘Business Units’ – Head Office & Stores. In this aspect, most of the employees are from ‘Stores’ (8163 employees) than ‘Head Office’ (173 employees). Generally, ‘Female’ employees are observed to show more absence (53.81%) than ‘Male’ employees (46.19%). From the ‘Activeness’ point of view, ‘Male’ employees shows 99.85% rate, while the ‘Female’ employees shows 99.82% rate, which is of not much difference. When observing from the ‘Head Office’ point of view, ‘absence’ rate is seen to be higher amongst the ‘female’ employees (58.74%), than the ‘male’ employees (41.26%). ‘Activeness’ is observed at a consistent rate amongst the employees (‘female’ employees - 99.96% & ‘male’ employees – 99.97%). From the ‘Dept. wise’ point of view, on an average, ‘absent hours’ is observed to be more in the ‘Recruitment’ dept. (63 Hours), followed by ‘Training’ dept. (61 Hours), ‘Employee Records’ dept. (60 Hours), and so on. In such an aspect, ‘Directors from Audit & Labor Relations’ are observed to have more ‘years of service’ in the respective fields (39 years each) amongst others, on an average. When observing from the ‘Stores’ point of view, ‘absence’ rate is seen to be higher amongst the ‘female’ employees (53.73%), than the ‘male’ employees (46.27%). ‘Activeness’ is observed at a consistent rate amongst the employees (‘female’ employees - 99.81% & ‘male’ employees – 99.84%). From the ‘Dept. wise’ point of view, on an average, ‘absent hours’ is observed to be more in the ‘Customer Service’ dept., ‘Dairy’ dept., and ‘Processed Foods’ dept. (63 Hours each). In such an aspect, ‘Dairy Managers’ are observed to have more ‘years of service’ in the respective field (5 years) amongst others, on an average. When analyzing the impact on ‘Age’ over the ‘Absent Hours’, from the ‘Head Office’ point of view, as the employees’ ‘age’ increases, the ‘absent hours’ shows an inconsistent pattern, i.e., increase/decrease is shown at a nearer stage. ‘Instability within the work load or work pressure’ must be the prevailing cause in this aspect. From the ‘Stores’ point of view, as the employees’ ‘age’ increases, the ‘absent hours’ shows a consistent pattern, i.e., ‘absent hours’ also increases. ‘Comparatively ‘lesser’ work load or work pressure’ must be the prevailing cause in this aspect.
